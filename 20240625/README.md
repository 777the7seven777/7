# Isaiah 10:
## A REMNANT SHALL RETURN TO THE LORD
### Verses 20-21
**20** And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again stay upon him that smote them; but shall stay upon the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.  
**21** The remnant shall return, even the remnant of Jacob, unto the mighty God.

### Verses 24-27
**24** Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall smite thee with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against thee, after the manner of Egypt.  
**25** For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease, and mine anger in their destruction.  
**26** And the LORD of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and as his rod was upon the sea, so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt.  
**27** And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing.

# Isaiah 11:
## A BRANCH OF JESSE
### Verses 1-13
**1** And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:  
**2** And the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD;  
**3** And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the LORD: and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears:  
**4** But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.  
**5** And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins.  
**6** The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.  
**7** And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.  
**8** And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den.  
**9** They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.  
**10** And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and his rest shall be glorious.  
**11** And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.  
**12** And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.  
**13** The envy also of Ephraim shall depart, and the adversaries of Judah shall be cut off: Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex Ephraim.

# Isaiah 12:
## THE LORD IS MY STRENGTH AND MY SONG

**1** And in that day thou shalt say, O LORD, I will praise thee: though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedst me.  
**2** Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the LORD JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation.  
**3** Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.  
**4** And in that day shall ye say, Praise the LORD, call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted.  
**5** Sing unto the LORD; for he hath done excellent things: this is known in all the earth.  
**6** Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.

# Isaiah 13:
## THE BURDEN OF BABYLON
### Verses 1-5
**1** The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.  
**2** Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice unto them, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles.  
**3** I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty ones for mine anger, even them that rejoice in my highness.  
**4** The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together: the LORD of hosts mustereth the host of the battle.  
**5** They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, even the LORD, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land.

## THE DESTRUCTIVE DAY OF THE LORD
### Verses 6-12
**6** Howl ye; for the day of the LORD is at hand; it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty.  
**7** Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man's heart shall melt:  
**8** And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth: they shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be as flames.  
**9** Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it.  
**10** For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.  
**11** And I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.  
**12** I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir.

## THE DESOLATION OF BABYLON
### Verses 19-20
**19** And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.  
**20** It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.

# Isaiah 14:
## A REST FROM BONDAGE
### Verses 1-3
**1** For the LORD will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, and set them in their own land: and the strangers shall be joined with them, and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob.  
**2** And the people shall take them, and bring them to their place: and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the LORD for servants and handmaids: and they shall take them captives, whose captives they were; and they shall rule over their oppressors.  
**3** And it shall come to pass in the day that the LORD shall give thee rest from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve,

## THE FALL OF BABYLON'S KING
### Verses 4-7
**4** That thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say, How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased!  
**5** The LORD hath broken the staff of the wicked, and the sceptre of the rulers.  
**6** He who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke, he that ruled the nations in anger, is persecuted, and none hindereth.  
**7** The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet: they break forth into singing.

### Verses 12-14
**12** How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!  
**13** For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:  
**14** I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.

## BABYLON TO BE CUT OFF
### Verses 15-17
**15** Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.  
**16** They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms;  
**17** That made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof; that opened not the house of his prisoners?

## PALESTINA WARNED NOT TO REJOICE
### Verses 28-32
**28** In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden.  
**29** Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that smote thee is broken: for out of the serpent's root shall come forth a cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent.  
**30** And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety: and I will kill thy root with famine, and he shall slay thy remnant.  
**31** Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou, whole Palestina, art dissolved: for there shall come from the north a smoke, and none shall be alone in his appointed times.  
**32** What shall one then answer the messengers of the nation? That the LORD hath founded Zion, and the poor of his people shall trust in it.

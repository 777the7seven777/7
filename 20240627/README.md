# Isaiah 20:
## THE SHAME OF EGYPT AND ETHIOPIA
### Verses 2-3
**2:** At the same time spake the Lord by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins, and put off thy shoe from thy foot. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.  
**3:** And the Lord said, Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and wonder upon Egypt and upon Ethiopia;

### Verse 6
**6:** And the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day, Behold, such is our expectation, whither we flee for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria: and how shall we escape?

# Isaiah 21:
## THE BURDEN OF THE DESERT OF THE SEA
### Verses 1-10
**1:** The burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the south pass through; so it cometh from the desert, from a terrible land.  
**2:** A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O Elam: besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.  
**3:** Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed down at the hearing of it; I was dismayed at the seeing of it.  
**4:** My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me.  
**5:** Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise, ye princes, and anoint the shield.  
**6:** For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth.  
**7:** And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen, a chariot of asses, and a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently with much heed:  
**8:** And he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole nights:  
**9:** And, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, with a couple of horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground.  
**10:** O my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have heard of the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared unto you.

# Isaiah 22:
## ELIAKIM'S RISE TO POWER
### Verses 20-25
**20:** And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah:  
**21:** And I will clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him with thy girdle, and I will commit thy government into his hand: and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah.  
**22:** And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder; so he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open.  
**23:** And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall be for a glorious throne to his father's house.  
**24:** And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's house, the offspring and the issue, all vessels of small quantity, from the vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of flagons.  
**25:** In that day, saith the Lord of hosts, shall the nail that is fastened in the sure place be removed, and be cut down, and fall; and the burden that was upon it shall be cut off: for the Lord hath spoken it.

# 2 Corinthians 8:
### Verses 1-15
**1:** Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;  
**2:** How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.  
**3:** For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves;  
**4:** Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.  
**5:** And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.  
**6:** Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.  
**7:** Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also.  
**8:** I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.  
**9:** For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.  
**10:** And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.  
**11:** Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have.  
**12:** For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.  
**13:** For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:  
**14:** But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality:  
**15:** As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no lack.

### Verses 22-23
**22:** And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you.  
**23:** Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren be enquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ.

# 2 Corinthians 9:
## MINISTRY TO THE SAINTS
### Verses 1-4
**1:** For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:  
**2:** For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many.  
**3:** Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:  
**4:** Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.

## GOD LOVES A CHEERFUL GIVER
### Verses 5-15
**5:** Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness.  
**6:** But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.  
**7:** Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.  
**8:** And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:  
**9:** (As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever.  
**10:** Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)  
**11:** Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God.  
**12:** For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God;  
**13:** Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men;  
**14:** And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you.  
**15:** Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.

# 2 Corinthians 10:
## MIGHTY WEAPONS OF WARFARE
### Verses 1-11
**1:** Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:  
**2:** But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.  
**3:** For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:  
**4:** (For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)  
**5:** Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;  
**6:** And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.  
**7:** Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ's, even so are we Christ's.  
**8:** For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:  
**9:** That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.  
**10:** For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.  
**11:** Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present.

## GOD'S RULE OF MEASURE
### Verses 12-18
**12:** For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.  
**13:** But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.  
**14:** For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ:  
**15:** Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,  
**16:** To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand.  
**17:** But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.  
**18:** For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.

# 2 Corinthians 11:
## GUARD AGAINST FALSE PREACHING
### Verses 1-13
**1:** Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me.  
**2:** For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.  
**3:** But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.  
**4:** For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him.  
**5:** For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.  
**6:** But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things.  
**7:** Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?  
**8:** I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service.  
**9:** And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself.  
**10:** As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia.  
**11:** Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.  
**12:** But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.  
**13:** For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.

## SUFFERING FOR THE LORD'S GLORY
### Verses 16-31
**16:** I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.  
**17:** That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.  
**18:** Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.  
**19:** For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.  
**20:** For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.  
**21:** I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.  
**22:** Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.  
**23:** Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.  
**24:** Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.  
**25:** Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;  
**26:** In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;  
**27:** In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.  
**28:** Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.  
**29:** Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?  
**30:** If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities.  
**31:** The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.

# 2 Corinthians 12:
## PAUL'S VISION OF PARADISE
### Verses 1-6
**1:** It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.  
**2:** I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.  
**3:** And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)  
**4:** How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.  
**5:** Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities.  
**6:** For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me.

## PAUL'S THORN IN THE FLESH
### Verses 7-10
**7:** And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.  
**8:** For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.  
**9:** And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.  
**10:** Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.

## THE SIGNS OF AN APOSTLE
### Verses 11-12
**11:** I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.  
**12:** Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.

## PAUL'S LOVE FOR THE CHURCH
### Verses 16-21
**16:** But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.  
**17:** Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?  
**18:** I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps?  
**19:** Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.  
**20:** For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:  
**21:** And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.

# 2 Corinthians 13:
## EXAMINE YOURSELVES
### Verses 1-10
**1:** This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.  
**2:** I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:  
**3:** Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.  
**4:** For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.  
**5:** Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?  
**6:** But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates.  
**7:** Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates.  
**8:** For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.  
**9:** For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish, even your perfection.  
**10:** Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction.

## LIVE IN PEACE
### Verses 11-14
**11:** Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.  
**12:** Greet one another with an holy kiss.  
**13:** All the saints salute you.  
**14:** The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.

# Matthew 21:42-46 (RECAP)
## THE PARABLE OF THE VINEYARD
**42** Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?  
**43** Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.  
**44** And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.  
**45** And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them.  
**46** But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet.

# Mark 12 (RECAP)
## THE PARABLE OF THE VINEYARD
**1** And he began to speak unto them by parables. A certain man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a place for the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.  
**2** And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.  
**3** And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.  
**4** And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully handled.  
**5** And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some.  
**6** Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.  
**7** But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.  
**8** And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.  
**9** What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.  
### Special Attention to Verses 10-12:
**10** And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner:  
**11** This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?  
**12** And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way.

## PAYING TRIBUTE
**13** And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in his words.  
**14** And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?  
**15** Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see it.  
**16** And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's.  
**17** And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at him.

## RESURRECTION QUESTIONS
**18** Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,  
**19** Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.  
**20** Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.  
**21** And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.  
**22** And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.  
**23** In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.  
**24** And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?  
**25** For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.  
**26** And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?  
**27** He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.

## THE FIRST COMMANDMENT OF ALL
**28** And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?  
### Special Attention to Verses 29-31:
**29** And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:  
**30** And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.  
**31** And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.  
**32** And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:  
**33** And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.  
**34** And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question.

## THE SCRIBES’ SAYING ABOUT CHRIST
**35** And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David?  
**36** For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.  
**37** David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his son? And the common people heard him gladly.

## THE WIDOW’S OFFERING OF TWO MITES
**38** And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces,  
**39** And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:  
**40** Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.  
**41** And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.  
**42** And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.  
**43** And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:  
**44** For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.

# Psalms 118 (RECAP)
## GOD’S MERCY
**1** O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: because his mercy endureth for ever.  
**2** Let Israel now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.  
**3** Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.  
**4** Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his mercy endureth for ever.  
**5** I called upon the LORD in distress: the LORD answered me, and set me in a large place.  
**6** The LORD is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me?  
**7** The LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.

## THE LORD IS ON MY SIDE
**8** It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man.  
**9** It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in princes.  
**10** All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD will I destroy them.  
**11** They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.  
**12** They compassed me about like bees: they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.  
**13** Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD helped me.  
**14** The LORD is my strength and song, and is become my salvation.  
**15** The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.  
**16** The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.  
**17** I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD.  
**18** The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over unto death.

## THE VOICE OF REJOICING AND SALVATION
**19** Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, and I will praise the LORD:  
**20** This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter.  
**21** I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation.  
### Special Attention to Verses 22-24:
**22** The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner.  
**23** This is the LORD's doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.  
**24** This is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.  
**25** Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech thee, send now prosperity.  
**26** Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD: we have blessed you out of the house of the LORD.  
**27** God is the LORD, which hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar.  
**28** Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, I will exalt thee.  
**29** O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.

# Isaiah 6:1-13
## THE HOLY AND GLORIOUS LORD
**1** In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.  
**2** Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.  
**3** And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.  
**4** And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.  

## GOD CLEANSES ISAIAH
**5** Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.  
**6** Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:  
**7** And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.  

## ISAIAH’S MESSAGE TO BE REJECTED
**8** Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.  
**9** And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.  
**10** Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.  
**11** Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate,  
**12** And the LORD have removed men far away, and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land.  
**13** But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.

# Isaiah 7:10-16
## A SIGN FROM THE LORD
**10** Moreover the LORD spake again unto Ahaz, saying,  
**11** Ask thee a sign of the LORD thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.  
**12** But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD.  
**13** And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?  
**14** Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.  
**15** Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.  
**16** For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings.

# Isaiah 8:8-22
## SANCTIFY THE LORD OF HOSTS
**8** And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he shall reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.  
**9** Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces.  
**10** Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us.  
**11** For the LORD spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying,  
**12** Say ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.  
**13** Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.  
**14** And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.  
**15** And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.  
**16** Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.  
**17** And I will wait upon the LORD, that hideth his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him.  
**18** Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth in mount Zion.  

## SEEK THE LAW AND THE TESTIMONY
**19** And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their God? for the living to the dead?  
**20** To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.  
**21** And they shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry: and it shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse their king and their God, and look upward.  
**22** And they shall look unto the earth; and behold trouble and darkness, dimness of anguish; and they shall be driven to darkness.

# Isaiah 9:1-7
## A GREAT LIGHT
**1** Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the nations.  
**2** The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined.  
**3** Thou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy: they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.  
**4** For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian.  
**5** For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and garments rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire.  
**6** For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.  
**7** Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this.

# 2 Corinthians Chapter 7:
## JOYFUL IN TRIBULATION
**1** Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.  
**2** Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.  
**3** I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you.  
**4** Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.  
**5** For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were fears.  
**6** Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;  
**7** And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.  
**8** For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though it were but for a season.  
**9** Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing.  
**10** For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.  

## GODLY SORROW
**11** For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.  
**12** Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you.  
**13** Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.  
**14** For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth.  
**15** And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.  
**16** I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things.
